# 16 · The gray desktop
#
# Symptom: the already-sanitized image booted with a flat gray background and
# notifications as unstyled gray boxes. No errors in journalctl.
#
# Two independent causes, neither visible with the checks it was running:
#
#  a) `grep -rl gabriel` returned 0 matches because grep reads CONTENT, and a
#     symlink's target isn't content. 439 links were still pointing at the old
#     home, including the 431 omarchy-* commands in /usr/local/bin and the
#     active background (~/.local/state/omarchy/current/background).
#
#  b) It had mako, swayosd, walker and elephant installed. Omarchy 4 retires
#     them (bin/omarchy-upgrade-to-quattro uninstalls them) because quickshell
#     now does that job. mako activates over D-Bus and steals the
#     org.freedesktop.Notifications name from the shell.
#
# Fixed at the source: provision/src/sanitize.sh rewrites the symlinks and
# verifies the background resolves; stage3.sh no longer installs those four
# packages.
