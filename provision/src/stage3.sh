# --- clipboard shared with the host ---------------------------
# The SPICE clipboard goes through three hops:
#   SPICE client (UTM) <-virtio-> spice-vdagentd <-unix socket-> agent
# The daemon talks to the host; the session agent only talks to the
# daemon. The OFFICIAL agent hands the clipboard to X11 (vdagent.c:421 ->
# vdagent_clipboards_new(vdagent_display_get_x11(...)), zero references to
# wlr-data-control) and under Hyprland it dies with "cannot open display".
#
# omarchy-arm-vdagent fills that gap: same udscs protocol with the daemon,
# but wl-copy/wl-paste on the other side. The daemon stays as-is (with -X,
# see stage2): we're replacing the agent, NOT the daemon. Trying to talk over the
# virtio port directly leaves the daemon without a channel ("Device or resource
# busy") and the host ignores everything.
